ESMF Web Service - Simple Python Client
=======================================

The sample Python app shows how to connect to the ESMF Web Service
and issue some simple service requests.

Tested with Python 2.7

This requires pysimplesoap:

sudo python setup.py install	


If not installed, you'll need setuptools as well before installing above.

Download ez_setup.py and run "python ez_setup.py"


Type "python SimpleClient.py" to run.
