ESMF Web Service - Server components
====================================

This directory contains the SOAP web service and the Registrar.

First make sure AXIS2_HOME is set.


BUILD THE WEB SERVICE
========================

This assumes Tomcat and Axis2 have been installed.

To build and deploy the SOAP web service, run:
./deploy.sh

You will likely need to modify this file to adjust
directories to your environment.

If (and only if) you change the ESMF.wsdl file, run:
./generate.sh
which will run wsdl2java.sh to generate Java source files.

The server skeleton code will be overwritten and must be manually
copied from org.earthsystemmodeling.ws.ESMFSkeletonImpl
to org.earthsystemmodeling.ws.ESMFSkeleton.


BUILD and RUN THE REGISTRAR
============================

Run "ant registrar" to generate build/lib/registrar.jar

Run "./run_registrar.sh" to start the registrar.
